                        <p>JSS Mahavidyapeetha, Mysore has started a composite Degree College meant for boys & Girls at Chamarajanagar during the year 1967-68. This is a full pledged Institution with more than 2000 students both in PUC & Degree. This institution is started for the Rural community students up to 2000-01. The Government of Karnataka have started a Degree College to cater the needs of the students. Therefore our college has been converted in to a Women's College during 2000-01 with the approval of the University and the Government because there was no separate college for the women more 800 girls students are studying in this College, the Government of Karnataka during the year 2001-02 have directed the Management of the Private Colleges to bifurcate the Pre-University course from the composite Degree College and treat Pu College, and degree college seperately. </p>
